### Tier 1 - Least Difficult
```
As an admin     
When I visit an admin invoices index page
I see each of the invoices statuses
I also have the ability to manage all invoice statuses on the page at the same time.
I can change multiple statuses via a dropdown list or checkboxes.
When I click the update button, I see the changes reflected on the index page for each invoice I updated.
```

```
As an admin, merchant, or visitor
On all pages that list all merchants, invoices, or items
I see a button to sort the list alphabetically, and I see a button to sort by most recent date.
When I click these buttons, the list is updated accordingly.
```

### Tier 2 - Difficult

```
As an admin, I have the ability to see all items on the site
I can also filter the results of this page by any item attribute

What this could look like:
Search boxes for both name and description
Check boxes for merchant names
Greater than, less than, and equal to options for unit price
Greater than, less than, and equal to options for created at and updated at
```

### Tier 3- Most Difficult

#### OPEN ENDED FEATURE - Merchant Item Discounts
- As a merchant, I want to create bulk discounts on specific items so that customers are incentivized to purchase more from me.
- This feature should include full CRUD functionality for discounts.
- Discounts are specific to each merchant.
- Students are responsible for defining additional database tables, models and relationships. Use of a database diagram is highly encouraged.
- Students are responsible for determining where the discount CRUD functionality lives in the app. Use of wireframes is highly encouraged.
- Students do not need to add functionality to apply the discounts to invoices, only CRUD discounts for individual merchants.
