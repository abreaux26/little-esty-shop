## OPEN ENDED FEATURE

Merchant Item Discounts
As a merchant, I want to create bulk discounts on specific items so that customers are incentivised to purchase more from me.
* Add more information from the old bulk discounts final project.
This feature should include full CRUD functionality for discounts.
Discounts are specific to each merchant
Students are responsible for defining additional database tables, models and relationships. Use of a database diagram is highly encouraged.
Students are responsible for determining where the discount CRUD functionality lives in the app. Use of wireframes is highly encouraged.
Students do not need to add functionality to apply the discounts to invoices, only CRUD discounts for individual merchants.
